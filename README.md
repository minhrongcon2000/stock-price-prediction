# Using Recurrent Neural Networks In Stock Price Prediction
## Abstract
In this repository, I will build a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the stock price of Google in 2019. The data is taken from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com)

## Dependencies
* numpy
* matplotlib

Any missing dependencies can be installed by [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

## Instruction
Run rnn.py to see the results.

## Remark
This model's performance is so poor and there is so many things to improve with this. For example, we can add another LSTM unit to improve the performance
